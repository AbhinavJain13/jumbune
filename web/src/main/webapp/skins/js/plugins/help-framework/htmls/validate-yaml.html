<p> Now, what Jumbune does is it will validate the YAML file. 
For e.g. In case of Profiling validating the YAML file will validate whether Data Node or Task Tracker is working fine.
In case of any issues with the configuration it will alert user that this is not fine. Please change and once all configurations
are right it will give you the success message so that you can move to the further step.</p>
