<p>Cluster profiler analysis gives analysis of the whole cluster based on some parameters.
There are 3 sub sections in cluster profiler.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Data Center
		<ul>
			<li>This gives the racks of data centers and corresponding nodes in that rack.
	Jumbune also displays node ip of that node on hovering.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>Categories: There are three different sub categories in Categories section in Jumbune.
		<ul>
			<li>I/O based stats.</li>
			<li>JMX based stats that are inferred from hadoop Cluster.</li>
			<li>JMX abstractionsn stats that ony Jumbune gives.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>These sub categories contains further parameters so as to monitor Cluster Performance.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Network Latency
		<ul>
			<li>This gives the network traffic graph between all nodes in the cluster. 
The lighter is mesh line, lower is the network traffic and vice versa.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>Also there is functionality of adding the parameters in favorites and trends. So as to monitor those parameters frequently.</p>
